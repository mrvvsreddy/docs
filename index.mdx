The Cartesia API is the fastest, ultra-realistic voice AI platform. Purpose-built for developers, it serves state-of-the-art models for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text, enabling seamless conversational AI experiences.

## Sonic Models for Text-to-Speech

Sonic models take text input and and stream back ultra-realistic speech in response. They can also clone voices, with full control over pronunciation and accent.

**Sonic 3 is the world's fastest, most emotive, ultra-realistic text-to-speech model.** It can stream out the first byte of audio in just 90ms, making it perfect for real-time and conversational experiences as well as dubbing, narration, AI avatars, and more. (To put things into perspective, 90ms is about twice as fast as the blink of an eye.)

**If real-time performance is your top priority,** Sonic Turbo offers even better performance, streaming out the first byte of audio in just 40ms.

Learn more about available Sonic model variants and their capabilities in the [TTS Models](/build/tts-models) section.

## Ink Models for Speech-to-Text

Ink models provide streaming speech-to-text transcription optimized for real-time voice applications.

**Ink-Whisper**, our debut model, is specifically engineered for conversational AI—handling telephony artifacts, background noise, accents, and proper nouns that typically challenge standard STT systems.

Ink-Whisper uses advanced dynamic chunking to process variable-length audio segments, reducing errors and hallucinations during pauses or audio gaps. At just $0.13/hour, it's the most affordable streaming STT model available.

Learn more about the Ink model and its capabilities in the [STT Models](/build/stt-models) section.
